    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are accustomed to speak with a certain light irony of the tendency
      which women have to gossip, as if the sin itself, if it is a sin, were of
      the gentler sex, and could by no chance be a masculine peccadillo. So far
      as my observation goes, men are as much given to small talk as women, and
      it is undeniable that we have produced the highest type of gossiper
      extant. Where will you find, in or out of literature, such another droll,
      delightful, chatty busybody as Samuel Pepys, Esq., Secretary to the
      Admiralty in the reigns of those fortunate gentlemen Charles II. and James
      II. of England? He is the king of tattlers as Shakespeare is the king of
      poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it came to a matter of pure gossip, I would back Our Club against the
      Sorosis or any women&rsquo;s club in existence. Whenever you see in our
      drawing-room four or five young fellows lounging in easy-chairs, cigar in
      hand, and now and then bringing their heads together over the small round
      Japanese table which is always the pivot of these social circles, you may
      be sure that they are discussing Tom&rsquo;s engagement, or Dick&rsquo;s extravagance,
      or Harry&rsquo;s hopeless passion for the younger Miss Fleurdelys. It is here
      old Tippleton gets execrated for that everlasting <i>bon mot</i> of his
      which was quite a success at dinner-parties forty years ago; it is here
      the belle of the season passes under the scalpels of merciless young
      surgeons; it is here B&rsquo;s financial condition is handled in a way that
      would make B&rsquo;s hair stand on end; it is here, in short, that everything is
      canvassed&mdash;everything that happens in our set, I mean, much that
      never happens, and a great deal that could not possibly happen. It was at
      Our Club that I learned the particulars of the Van Twiller affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was great entertainment to Our Club, the Van Twiller affair, though it
      was rather a joyless thing, I fancy, for Van Twiller. To understand the
      case fully, it should be understood that Ralph Van Twiller is one of the
      proudest and most sensitive men living. He is a lineal descendant of
      Wouter Van Twiller, the famous old Dutch governor of New York&mdash;Nieuw
      Amsterdam, as it was then; his ancestors have always been burgomasters or
      admirals or generals, and his mother is the Mrs. Vanrensselaer Van-zandt
      Van Twiller whose magnificent place will be pointed out to you on the
      right bank of the Hudson, as you pass up the historic river towards
      Idlewild. Ralph is about twenty-five years old. Birth made him a
      gentleman, and the rise of real estate&mdash;some of it in the family
      since the old governor&rsquo;s time&mdash;made him a millionaire. It was a
      kindly fairy that stepped in and made him a good fellow also. Fortune, I
      take it, was in her most jocund mood when she heaped her gifts in this
      fashion on Van Twiller, who was, and will be again, when this cloud blows
      over, the flower of Our Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a year ago there came a whisper&mdash;if the word &ldquo;whisper&rdquo; is not
      too harsh a term to apply to what seemed a mere breath floating gently
      through the atmosphere of the billiard-room&mdash;imparting the
      intelligence that Van Twiller was in some kind of trouble. Just as
      everybody suddenly takes to wearing square-toed boots, or to drawing his
      neckscarf through a ring, so it became all at once the fashion, without
      any preconcerted agreement, for everybody to speak of Van Twilier as a man
      in some way under a cloud. But what the cloud was, and how he got under
      it, and why he did not get away from it, were points that lifted
      themselves into the realm of pure conjecture. There was no man in the club
      with strong enough wing to his imagination to soar to the supposition that
      Van Twiller was embarrassed in money matters. Was he in love? That
      appeared nearly as improbable; for if he had been in love all the world&mdash;that
      is, perhaps a hundred first families&mdash;would have known all about it
      instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has the symptoms,&rdquo; said Delaney, laughing. &ldquo;I remember once when Jack
      Hemming &ldquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ned!&rdquo; cried Hemming, &ldquo;I protest against any allusion to that business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was one night when Van Twiller had wandered into the club, turned
      over the magazines absently in the reading-room, and wandered out again
      without speaking ten words. The most careless eye would have remarked the
      great change that had come over Van Twiller. Now and then he would play a
      game of billiards with De Peyster or Haseltine, or stop to chat a moment
      in the vestibule with old Duane; but he was an altered man. When at the
      club, he was usually to be found in the small smoking-room up-stairs,
      seated on a fauteuil fast asleep, with the last number of The Nation in
      his hand. Once, if you went to two or three places of an evening, you were
      certain to meet Van Twiller at them all. You seldom met him in society
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by came whisper number two&mdash;a whisper more emphatic than
      number one, but still untraceable to any tangible mouthpiece. This time
      the whisper said that Van Twiller <i>was</i> in love. But with whom? The
      list of possible Mrs. Van Twillers was carefully examined by experienced
      hands, and a check placed against a fine old Knickerbocker name here and
      there, but nothing satisfactory arrived at. Then that same still small
      voice of rumor, but now with an easily detected staccato sharpness to it,
      said that Van Twiller was in love&mdash;with an actress! Van Twiller, whom
      it had taken all these years and all this waste of raw material in the way
      of ancestors to bring to perfection&mdash;Ralph Van Twiller, the net
      result and flower of his race, the descendant of Wouter, the son of Mrs.
      Van-rensselaer Vanzandt Van Twiller&mdash;in love with an actress! That
      was too ridiculous to be believed&mdash;and so everybody believed it. Six
      or seven members of the club abruptly discovered in themselves an
      unsuspected latent passion for the histrionic art. In squads of two or
      three they stormed successively all the theatres in town&mdash;Booth&rsquo;s,
      Wallack&rsquo;s, Daly&rsquo;s Fifth Avenue (not burnt down then), and the Grand Opera
      House. Even the shabby homes of the drama over in the Bowery, where the
      Germanic Thespis has not taken out his naturalization papers, underwent
      rigid exploration. But no clue was found to Van Twiller&rsquo;s mysterious
      attachment. The <i>op√©ra bouffe</i>, which promised the widest field for
      investigation, produced absolutely nothing, not even a crop of suspicions.
      One night, after several weeks of this, Delaney and I fancied that we
      caught sight of Van Twiller in the private box of an up-town theatre,
      where some thrilling trapeze performance was going on, which we did not
      care to sit through; but we concluded afterwards that it was only somebody
      who looked like him. Delaney, by the way, was unusually active in this
      search. I dare say he never quite forgave Van Twiller for calling him
      Muslin Delaney. Ned is fond of ladies&rsquo; society, and that&rsquo;s a fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cimmerian darkness which surrounded Van Twiller&rsquo;s inamorata left us
      free to indulge in the wildest conjectures. Whether she was black-tressed
      Melpomene, with bowl and dagger, or Thalia, with the fair hair and the
      laughing face, was only to be guessed at. It was popularly conceded,
      however, that Van Twiller was on the point of forming a dreadful <i>m√©salliance</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this period he had visited the club regularly. Suddenly he ceased to
      appear. He was not to be seen on Fifth Avenue, or in the Central Park, or
      at the houses he generally frequented. His chambers&mdash;and mighty
      comfortable chambers they were&mdash;on Thirty-fourth Street were
      deserted. He had dropped out of the world, shot like a bright particular
      star from his orbit in the heaven of the best society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following conversation took place one night in the smoking-room:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Van Twiller?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s seen Van Twiller?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has become of Van Twiller?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delaney picked up the Evening Post, and read&mdash;with a solemnity that
      betrayed young Firkins into exclaiming, &ldquo;By Jove, now!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married, on the 10th instant, by the Rev. Friar Laurence, at the
      residence of the bride&rsquo;s uncle, Montague Capulet, Esq., Miss Adrienne Le
      Couvreur to Mr. Ralph Van Twiller, both of this city. No cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free List suspended,&rdquo; murmured De Peyster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me,&rdquo; said Frank Livingstone, who had been ruffling the leaves
      of a magazine at the other end of the table, &ldquo;that you fellows are in a
      great fever about Van Twiller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he has simply gone out of town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to the old homestead on the Hudson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an odd time of year for a fellow to go into the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has gone to visit his mother,&rdquo; said Livingstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In February?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t know, Delaney, that there was any statute in force prohibiting
      a man from visiting his mother in February if he wants to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delaney made some light remark about the pleasure of communing with Nature
      with a cold in her head, and the topic was dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Livingstone was hand in glove with Van Twilier, and if any man shared his
      confidence it was Livingstone. He was aware of the gossip and speculation
      that had been rife in the club, but he either was not at liberty or did
      not think it worth while to relieve our curiosity. In the course of a week
      or two it was reported that Van Twiller was going to Europe; and go he
      did. A dozen of us went down to the Scythia to see him off. It was
      refreshing to have something as positive as the fact that Van Twiller had
      sailed.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shortly after Van Twiller&rsquo;s departure the whole thing came out. Whether
      Livingstone found the secret too heavy a burden, or whether it transpired
      through some indiscretion on the part of Mrs. Vanrensselaer Vanzandt Van
      Twiller, I cannot say; but one evening the entire story was in the
      possession of the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Van Twiller had actually been very deeply interested&mdash;not in an
      actress, for the legitimate drama was not her humble walk in life, but&mdash;in
      Mademoiselle Olympe Zabriski, whose really perilous feats on the trapeze
      had astonished New York the year before, though they had failed to attract
      Delaney and me the night we wandered into the up-town theatre on the trail
      of Van Twiller&rsquo;s mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a man like Van Twiller should be fascinated even for an instant by a
      common circus-girl seems incredible; but it is always the incredible thing
      that happens. Besides, Mademoiselle Olympe was not a common circus-girl;
      she was a most daring and startling gymnaste, with a beauty and a grace of
      movement that gave to her audacious performance almost an air of prudery.
      Watching her wondrous dexterity and pliant strength, both exercised
      without apparent effort, it seemed the most natural proceeding in the
      world that she should do those unpardonable things. She had a way of
      melting from one graceful posture into another, like the dissolving
      figures thrown from a stereopticon. She was a lithe, radiant shape out of
      the Grecian mythology, now poised up there above the gaslights, and now
      gleaming through the air like a slender gilt arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am describing Mademoiselle Olympe as she appeared to Van Twiller on the
      first occasion when he strolled into the theatre where she was performing.
      To me she was a girl of eighteen or twenty years of age (maybe she was
      much older, for pearl-powder and distance keep these people perpetually
      young), slightly but exquisitely built, with sinews of silver wire; rather
      pretty, perhaps, after a manner, but showing plainly the effects of the
      exhaustive drafts she was making on her physical vitality. Now, Van
      Twiller was an enthusiast on the subject of calisthenics. &ldquo;If I had a
      daughter,&rdquo; Van Twiller used to say, &ldquo;I would n&rsquo;t send her to a
      boarding-school, or a nunnery; I &lsquo;d send her to a gymnasium for the first
      five years. Our American women have no physique. They are lilies, pallid,
      pretty&mdash;and perishable. You marry an American woman, and what do you
      marry? A headache. Look at English girls. They are at least roses, and
      last the season through.&rdquo; Walking home from the theatre that first night,
      it flitted through Van Twiller&rsquo;s mind that if he could give this girl&rsquo;s
      set of nerves and muscles to any one of the two hundred high-bred women he
      knew, he would marry her on the spot and worship her forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following evening he went to see Mademoiselle Olympe again. &ldquo;Olympe
      Zabriski,&rdquo; he soliloquized, as he sauntered through the lobby&mdash;&ldquo;what
      a queer name! Olympe is French, and Zabriski is Polish. It is her <i>nom
      de guerre</i>, of course; her real name is probably Sarah Jones. What kind
      of creature can she be in private life, I wonder? I wonder if she wears
      that costume all the time, and if she springs to her meals from a
      horizontal bar. Of course she rocks the baby to sleep on the trapeze.&rdquo; And
      Van Twiller went on making comical domestic tableaux of Mademoiselle
      Zabriski, like the clever, satirical dog he was, until the curtain rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was on a Friday. There was a matin√©e the next day, and he attended
      that, though he had secured a seat for the usual evening entertainment.
      Then it became a habit of Van Twiller&rsquo;s to drop into the theatre for half
      an hour or so every night, to assist at the interlude, in which she
      appeared. He cared only for her part of the programme, and timed his
      visits accordingly. It was a surprise to himself when he reflected, one
      morning, that he had not missed a single performance of Mademoiselle
      Olympe for nearly two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will never do,&rdquo; said Van Twiller. &ldquo;Olympe&rdquo;&mdash;he called her
      Olympe, as if she were an old acquaintance, and so she might have been
      considered by that time&mdash;&ldquo;is a wonderful creature; but this will
      never do. Van, my boy, you must reform this altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But half past nine that night saw him in his accustomed orchestra chair,
      and so on for another week. A habit leads a man so gently in the beginning
      that he does not perceive he is led&mdash;with what silken threads and
      down what pleasant avenues it leads him! By and by the soft silk threads
      become iron chains, and the pleasant avenues Avernus!
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite a new element had lately entered into Van Twiller&rsquo;s enjoyment of
      Mademoiselle Olympe&rsquo;s ingenious feats&mdash;a vaguely born apprehension
      that she might slip from that swinging bar; that one of the thin cords
      supporting it might snap, and let her go headlong from the dizzy height.
      Now and then, for a terrible instant, he would imagine her lying a
      glittering, palpitating heap at the foot-lights, with no color in her
      lips! Sometimes it seemed as if the girl were tempting this kind of fate.
      It was a hard, bitter life, and nothing but poverty and sordid misery at
      home could have driven her to it. What if she should end it all some
      night, by just unclasping that little hand? It looked so small and white
      from where Van Twiller sat!
    </p>
    <p>
      This frightful idea fascinated while it chilled him, and helped to make it
      nearly impossible for him to keep away from the theatre. In the beginning
      his attendance had not interfered with his social duties or pleasures; but
      now he came to find it distasteful after dinner to do anything but read,
      or walk the streets aimlessly, until it was time to go to the play. When
      that was over, he was in no mood to go anywhere but to his rooms. So he
      dropped away by insensible degrees from his habitual haunts, was missed,
      and began to be talked about at the club. Catching some intimation of
      this, he ventured no more in the orchestra stalls, but shrouded himself
      behind the draperies of the private box in which Delaney and I thought we
      saw him on one occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I find it very perplexing to explain what Van Twiller was wholly
      unable to explain to himself. He was not in love with Mademoiselle Olympe.
      He had no wish to speak to her, or to hear her speak. Nothing could have
      been easier, and nothing further from his desire, than to know her
      personally. A Van Twiller personally acquainted with a strolling female
      acrobat! Good heavens I That was something possible only with the
      discovery of perpetual motion. Taken from her theatrical setting, from her
      lofty perch, so to say, on the trapeze-bar, Olympe Zabriski would have
      shocked every aristocratic fibre in Van Twiller&rsquo;s body. He was simply
      fascinated by her marvellous grace and <i>√©lan</i>, and the magnetic
      recklessness of the girl. It was very young in him and very weak, and no
      member of the Sorosis, or all the Sorosisters together, could have been
      more severe on Van Twiller than he was on himself. To be weak, and to know
      it, is something of a punishment for a proud man. Van Twiller took his
      punishment, and went to the theatre, regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When her engagement comes to an end,&rdquo; he meditated, &ldquo;that will finish the
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Olympe&rsquo;s engagement finally did come to an end, and she
      departed. But her engagement had been highly beneficial to the
      treasury-chest of the up-town theatre, and before Van Twiller could get
      over missing her she had returned from a short Western tour, and her
      immediate reappearance was underlined on the play-bills.

    <p>
      On a dead-wall opposite the windows of Van Twiller&rsquo;s sleeping-room there
      appeared, as if by necromancy, an aggressive poster with Mademoiselle
      Olympe Zabriski on it in letters at least a foot high. This thing stared
      him in the face when he woke up, one morning. It gave him a sensation as
      if she had called on him overnight, and left her card.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time through the day he regarded that poster with a sardonic
      eye. He had pitilessly resolved not to repeat the folly of the previous
      month. To say that this moral victory cost him nothing would be to deprive
      it of merit. It cost him many internal struggles. It is a fine thing to
      see a man seizing his temptation by the throat, and wrestling with it, and
      trampling it under foot like St. Anthony. This was the spectacle Van
      Twiller was exhibiting to the angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening Mademoiselle Olympe was to make her reappearance, Van Twiller,
      having dined at the club, and feeling more like himself than he had felt
      for weeks, returned to his chamber, and, putting on dressing-gown and
      slippers, piled up the greater portion of his library about him, and fell
      to reading assiduously. There is nothing like a quiet evening at home with
      some slight intellectual occupation, after one&rsquo;s feathers have been
      stroked the wrong way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the lively French clock on the mantel-piece&mdash;a base of malachite
      surmounted by a flying bronze Mercury with its arms spread gracefully on
      the air, and not remotely suggestive of Mademoiselle Olympe in the act of
      executing her grand flight from the trapeze&mdash;when the clock, I
      repeat, struck nine, Van Twilier paid no attention to it. That was
      certainly a triumph. I am anxious to render Van Twiller all the justice I
      can, at this point of the narrative, inasmuch as when the half hour
      sounded musically, like a crystal ball dropping into a silver bowl, he
      rose from the chair automatically, thrust his feet into his walking-shoes,
      threw his overcoat across his arm, and strode out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be weak and to scorn your weakness, and not to be able to conquer it,
      is, as has been said, a hard thing; and I suspect it was not with
      unalloyed satisfaction that Van Twiller found himself taking his seat in
      the back part of the private box night after night during the second
      engagement of Mademoiselle Olympe. It was so easy not to stay away!
    </p>
    <p>
      In this second edition of Van Twiller&rsquo;s fatuity, his case was even worse
      than before. He not only thought of Olympo quite a number of times between
      breakfast and dinner, he not only attended the interlude regularly, but he
      began, in spite of himself, to occupy his leisure hours at night by
      dreaming of her. This was too much of a good thing, and Van Twiller
      regarded it so. Besides, the dream was always the same&mdash;a harrowing
      dream, a dream singularly adapted to shattering the nerves of a man like
      Van Twiller. He would imagine himself seated at the theatre (with all the
      members of Our Club in the parquette), watching Mademoiselle Olympe as
      usual, when suddenly that young lady would launch herself desperately from
      the trapeze, and come flying through the air like a firebrand hurled at
      his private box. Then the unfortunate man would wake up with cold drops
      standing on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one redeeming feature in this infatuation of Van Twiller&rsquo;s which
      the sober moralist will love to look upon&mdash;the serene unconsciousness
      of the person who caused it. She went through her <i>r√¥le</i> with
      admirable aplomb, drew her salary, it may be assumed, punctually, and
      appears from first to last to have been ignorant that there was a
      miserable slave wearing her chains nightly in the left-hand
      proscenium-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Van Twiller, haunting the theatre with the persistency of an
      ex-actor, conducted himself so discreetly as not to draw the fire of
      Mademoiselle Olympe&rsquo;s blue eyes shows that Van Twiller, however deeply
      under a spell, was not in love. I say this, though I think if Van Twiller
      had not been Van Twiller, if he had been a man of no family and no
      position and no money, if New York had been Paris and Thirty-fourth Street
      a street in the Latin Quarter&mdash;but it is useless to speculate on what
      might have happened. What did happen is sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened, then, in the second week of Queen Olympe&rsquo;s second unconscious
      reign, that an appalling Whisper floated up the Hudson, effected a landing
      at a point between Spuyten Duyvel Creek and Cold Spring, and sought out a
      stately mansion of Dutch architecture standing on the bank of the river.
      The Whisper straightway informed the lady dwelling in this mansion that
      all was not well with the last of the Van Twillers; that he was gradually
      estranging himself from his peers, and wasting his nights in a play-house
      watching a misguided young woman turning unmaidenly somersaults on a piece
      of wood attached to two ropes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vanrensselaer Vanzandt Van Twiller came down to town by the next
      train to look into this little matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found the flower of the family taking an early breakfast, at 11 a.m.,
      in his cosey apartments on Thirty-fourth Street. With the least possible
      circumlocution she confronted him with what rumor had reported of his
      pursuits, and was pleased, but not too much pleased, when he gave her an
      exact account of his relations with Mademoiselle Zabriski, neither
      concealing nor qualifying anything. As a confession, it was unique, and
      might have been a great deal less entertaining. Two or three times in the
      course of the narrative, the matron had some difficulty in preserving the
      gravity of her countenance. After meditating a few minutes, she tapped Van
      Twiller softly on the arm with the tip of her parasol, and invited him to
      return with her the next day up the Hudson and make a brief visit at the
      home of his ancestors. He accepted the invitation with outward alacrity
      and inward disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this was settled, and the worthy lady had withdrawn, Van Twiller went
      directly to the establishment of Messrs Ball, Black, and Company, and
      selected, with unerring taste, the finest diamond bracelet procurable. For
      his mother? Dear me, no! She had the family jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not like to state the enormous sum Van Twiller paid for this
      bracelet. It was such a clasp of diamonds as would have hastened the
      pulsation of a patrician wrist. It was such a bracelet as Prince
      Camaralzaman might have sent to the Princess Badoura, and the Princess
      Badoura&mdash;might have been very glad to get.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fragrant Levant morocco case, where these happy jewels lived when
      they were at home, Van Twiller thoughtfully placed his card, on the back
      of which he had written a line begging Mademoiselle Olympe Zabriski to
      accept the accompanying trifle from one who had witnessed her graceful
      performances with interest and pleasure. This was not done
      inconsiderately. &ldquo;Of course I must enclose my card, as I would to any
      lady,&rdquo; Van Twiller had said to himself. &ldquo;A Van Twiller can neither write
      an anonymous letter nor make an anonymous present.&rdquo; Blood entails its
      duties as well As its privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The casket despatched to its destination, Van Twiller felt easier in his
      mind. He was under obligations to the girl for many an agreeable hour that
      might otherwise have passed heavily. He had paid the debt, and he had paid
      it <i>en prince</i>, as became a Van Twiller. He spent the rest of the day
      in looking at some pictures at Goupil&rsquo;s, and at the club, and in making a
      few purchases for his trip up the Hudson. A consciousness that this trip
      up the Hudson was a disorderly retreat came over him unpleasantly at
      intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to his rooms late at night, he found a note lying on the
      writing-table. He started as his eye caught the words &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      Theatre&rdquo; stamped in carmine letters on one corner of the envelope. Van
      Twiller broke the seal with trembling fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this note some time afterwards fell into the hands of Livingstone,
      who showed it to Stuyvesant, who showed it to Delaney, who showed it to
      me, and I copied it as a literary curiosity. The note ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

     Charles Montmorenci Walters.
</pre>
    <p>
      The next day Van Twiller neither expressed nor felt any unwillingness to
      spend a few weeks with his mother at the old homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he went abroad.
